# Project Mongo API

Creating a RESTful API using a database to store and retrieve data froom it using Mongoose/MongoDB.

## The problem

I added the .env to keep sensitive information. The API that is hidden is:
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost/project-mongo I made the mistake to push to GitHub before solving everything so for this time it's in the history of GitHub which I will avoid next time.

## View it live
